# legolas

Legolas was the son of Thranduil, King of the Woodland Realm of Northern Mirkwood,[1][2] who appears as "the Elvenking" in The Hobbit.[3] Thranduil ruled over the Silvan Elves or "Wood-elves" of Mirkwood.[1]

Although he lived among the Silvan Elves, Legolas was not one himself. His father Thranduil had originally come from Lindon; he and his son were actually Sindar, or "Grey Elves", called in the singular Sinda; "Sindarin" was their language. Thranduil himself was the son of Oropher. Legolas's mother is never mentioned; the Elves of Mirkwood have no Queen at the time of The Hobbit.

Legolas was introduced in The Fellowship of the Ring, at the Council of Elrond in Rivendell, where he came as a messenger from his father to discuss Gollum's escape from their guard.[1] Legolas was chosen to be a member of the Fellowship of the Ring, charged with destroying the One Ring. He accompanied the other members in their travels from Rivendell to Amon Hen, serving as the company's archer.[4]

When the fellowship was trapped by a snowstorm while crossing the dangerous mountain Caradhras, Legolas scouted ahead, and told Aragorn and Boromir that the thick snow they were trying to push through was only a narrow wall, and below it the snow was more shallow.[4] When the attempt to cross Caradhras failed, Gandalf led the fellowship on a journey underground through Moria, an ancient Dwarf-kingdom, though some (including Legolas) did not wish to travel there. Before they reached Moria, Legolas helped fend off an attack by wolves in Hollin. In Moria, he helped fight off orcs and recognized "Durin's Bane" as a Balrog of Morgoth.[5] After Gandalf was lost, Aragorn took charge of the fellowship and led them to the Elven realm of Lothlórien, the Golden Wood. Legolas served as the initial spokesperson for the company, speaking with the inhabitants, the Galadhrim, whom he considered close kin.[6]

There was initially friction between Legolas and the dwarf Gimli, because of the ancient quarrel between Elves and Dwarves arising from the destruction of Doriath in the First Age; and also because Thranduil once imprisoned Gimli's father Glóin. Moreover, the dwarves of Erebor disliked Thranduil ever since he refused to pay them for crafting his raw metals.[3] However Legolas and Gimli began to become friends when Gimli greeted the Elven queen Galadriel respectfully.[6] When the fellowship left Lothlórien, Galadriel and Celeborn gave the members gifts; Legolas received a new longbow.[7] Legolas used the bow to bring down a "fell beast" in the dark with one shot.[8]

After Boromir was killed and Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took were captured by orcs in The Two Towers, Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli set forth across Rohan in pursuit of the two captured hobbits.[9] In the forest of Fangorn Legolas and his companions met Gandalf, resurrected as "Gandalf the White," who delivered a message to Legolas from Galadriel – which Legolas interprets as foretelling the coming end of his sojourn in Middle Earth and the waking of the unconquerable sea-longing latent in all Elves who yet inhabit mortal lands:

"Legolas Greenleaf long under the tree,
In joy thou hast lived, Beware the Sea!
If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore,
Thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more."[10]
The three met with the Rohirrim, fought in the Battle of the Hornburg, and witnessed Saruman's downfall at Isengard together with Gandalf, where they were reunited with Merry and Pippin. In the Battle of the Hornburg, Legolas and Gimli kept count of the orcs they kill, a contest which Gimli won by one, killing forty-two to Legolas's forty-one, but the real result was stronger mutual respect.[11]

In The Return of the King, Legolas and Gimli accompanied Aragorn and the Grey Company on the Paths of the Dead.[12] After Aragorn summoned the Dead Men of Dunharrow to fight for him, Legolas saw them frighten the Corsairs of Umbar from their ships at Pelargir. Galadriel's prophecy was fulfilled: as Legolas heard the cries of seagulls, he began to experience the Sea-longing — the desire to sail west to Valinor, the "Blessed Realm", which was latent among the Sindar.[13] He fought in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields[14] and of the Morannon[15] and watched as Sauron was defeated and Barad-dûr collapsed.[16]

After the destruction of the One Ring, Legolas remained in Minas Tirith for Aragorn's crowning and marriage to Arwen. Later, Legolas and Gimli travelled together through Fangorn forest and to the Glittering Caves of Helm's Deep, as Legolas had promised Gimli.[17] Around the 20th year of the Fourth Age,[18] Legolas brought south Elves out of Greenwood, and they dwelt in Ithilien, and it became once again the "fairest country in all the westlands."[19] They stayed in Ithilien for "a hundred years of Men."[20] After King Aragorn died, Legolas built a small ship and sailed West, reportedly taking Gimli with him.[21]
